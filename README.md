# CNN-Image-Classification-TensorFlow-Keras
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories. The model applies Batch Normalization, Dropout, and L2 Regularization to improve generalization and reduce overfitting. Training Samples: 50,000 Testing Samples: 10,000.
